Coding Project ­ We Like Lunch

Background

This project is driven from the fact that we like lunch, but often have a hard time deciding where to go. In addition, once somebody does find someplace they like, word can be slow to spread, and information is often lost over time.

Project Goals

The goal of this project is to have a functional application which allows our internal team to identify themselves, suggest places to eat to the team, and which allows team members to rate a restaurant up or down based on their past experiences. In addition, users should be able to leave comments about a location.

Project Requirements
1. A user should be able to identify themselves so other team members know who made a suggestion, who rated, and who left a comment.
2. A restaurant should have the ability to be rated (thumbs up or thumbs down), and a rating summary should be visible to users.
3. A restaurant should have the ability to be commented on, and comments should be visible to users.

Technical Stuff
● Post the project to GitHub, we’ll take a look at your commits and code.
● Build this project as if it’s going into production. Someone besides you will probably have to maintain this code.

Bonus Points (totally optional)
● Rating history ­ for a given restaurant, show a timeline of ratings over time (in case the place has gone downhill).
● Google Apps For Business integration for authentication (allowing only @poolsupplyworld.com email addresses to login).
● Allow people to get into a group and vote on where to go to lunch that day.
● Allow address input on restaurant, with link to google maps.
● Host the project somewhere where we can take it for a test drive.
